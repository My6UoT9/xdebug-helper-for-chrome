XDebug Helper for Microsoft Edge
===============================

Debugging, profiling and tracing PHP code with [Xdebug](https://xdebug.org/) is very powerful, but enabling
Xdebug with cookies or adding POST/GET variables is way too hard. This extension will help you to enable/disable
debugging, profiling and tracing of your PHP-code easily.

Hotkeys
-------
Ctrl+Shift+X (Cmd+Shift+X on Mac) opens the popup.  
Alt+Shift+X toggles the debugging state.

How to install this extension?
------------------------------
**Stable version:** Go to the [Microsoft Edge Addons](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/ggnngifabofaddiejjeagbaebkejomen)
and click "Get".
